Our client is FashionCo, a player in the women's fashion market. Itâ€™s been in the industry for a long time, but has experienced declining revenues each year for the past five years.

FashionCo wants to understand:

What is causing this decline?
What can the organization do to drive revenue?
FashionCo will have a management meeting at the end of the week, and the CEO wants a recommendation from Bain on how to proceed.

What can they do to drive revenue?
